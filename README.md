  - CI Workflows:
    - Test
    - Format check
    - Clippy
    - Docs
    - Publish
    - Code coverage report on PR
  - CD Workflows (Release artifacts on Cargo and Github):
    - os: macos-latest
      target: x86_64-apple-darwin

    - dependabot to update dependencies weekly
- build automation via [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-build.html),
- dependency management using [Cargo Modules](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch07-00-managing-growing-projects-with-packages-crates-and-modules.html),
- code formatting using [rust fmt](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustfmt/),
- linting with [clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy),
- code coverage [HTML report](https://docs.codecov.com/docs) and tests
- releasing using [Github Release](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository),
- dependencies scanning and updating thanks to [Dependabot](https://dependabot.com),
- security code analysis using [Audit-check](https://github.com/actions-rs/audit-check),

## Usage

1. Sign up on [Codecov](https://codecov.io/) and configure
   [Codecov GitHub Application](https://github.com/apps/codecov) for all repositories.
1. Click the `Use this template` button (alt. clone or download this repository).
1. Replace all occurrences of `runtime-machines/rust-template` to `your_org/repo_name` in all files.
1. Replace all occurrences of `rust-template` to `repo_name` in all files.
1. Set up `CODECOV_TOKEN` secret in `https://github.com/runtime-machines/REPO_NAME/settings/secrets/actions`.
1. Update the following files:
   - [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)
   - [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
   - [LICENSE](LICENSE) (when defined)
   - [README.md](README.md)
1. Uncomment the necessary workflow paths in the ci.yml workflow and add the ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }} secret if you're planning to keep the repository private. Also you might need to add a /script/run.sh and a migration folder, depending on your SQLX needs
1. To add a deploy key in order to use a private dependency:
   - uncomment the `ssh-agent` step
   - generate the key on your local machine using `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "<key_description:key_owner@runtimemachines.com>"`
   - Add the .pub to the source repository deploy keys
   - Add the private key in this repository secrets
   - Add the secret to the `ssh-private-key` in the `ssh-agent` step 
1. Uncomment SQLX-CLI and the SQLX-CLI cache step if necessary (installation path of SQLX-CLI will be ~/.cargo/)
